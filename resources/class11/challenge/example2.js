// 1. A school's film club wants to store details of the films it has studied so far this year. 
//Create a new class to do this. We want to store the following data about each film: id, title, director, releaseYear and genres.

// 2. Create two methods on the class: one for adding multiple genres to the films
// - addGenre(genre) - and one to get the title of the film - getFilmTitle().

// 3. Instantiate a new instance of the class using data from your your favourite film. 
//Add at least 1 genre to your film using addGenre(), and get the title using getFilmTitle()

// Beginning:
class Film {
	//Your code here.
}

// Rest of your code here.
