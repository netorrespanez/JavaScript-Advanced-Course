/**
 * When we created the Person constructor function, it wasn't the only object we created. 
 * Automatically, we also created another object, called the prototype! 
 * By default, this object contains a constructor property, 
 * which is simply a reference to the original constructor function, Person in this case.
 * 
 * The prototype property on the Person constructor function is non-enumerable, 
 * meaning that it doesn't show up when we try to access the objects properties. But it's still there!

//it looks exactly like the Person.prototype object! Well guess what, __proto__ is a reference to the Person.prototype object. 
//This is what prototypal inheritance is all about: each instance of the constructor has access to the prototype of the constructor!
